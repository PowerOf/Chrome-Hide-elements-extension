# Chrome-Hide-elements-extension

This project is the first step on our way to create products that are highly usable, and put the user first.

At the moment the extension is capable to hide social media posts on 1 *one* website, which is reddit.
The happy path is for the user to manually right click anywhere within the post and choose 'Hide Element'

This is not very convenient at the moment but it's something that will be developed further.

Features

Right click on any post on your reddit feed, and choose 'Hide Elements'. The specific Reddit post will be hidden.
The extension works with the new reddit beta UI, and old reddit, and also Reddit Enhancement Suite.

You can also choose to unhide the latest/all of the hidden posts.

The state of the page is not saved so if you refresh the page, everything will be back as is.
All that it's doing is toggling the display attribute to none on the post.

Planned improvements:
Add other social media, such as youtube, and facebook.
Remember posts that you have hidden, even if you leave the page and come back.
Automate hiding based on criteria such as: posting account, subreddit, etc.
